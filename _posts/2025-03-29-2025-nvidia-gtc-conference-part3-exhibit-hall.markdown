## Exhibit Hall

In this final post, i explore the exhibit hall where many innovations from NVIDIA and its partners were on display. 
The exhibit hall was a lot of fun! Here are some of the most interesting exhibitors and equipment I managed to take a picture of.

### Server Racks and Infrastructure

Liquid-cooled racks consuming 150KW+ were on display — air cooling is no longer viable at these power levels.

### GB300 Hardware

The NVIDIA GB300 Grace Blackwell Ultra Superchip features four NVIDIA Blackwell Ultra GPUs, two NVIDIA Grace CPUs, and four NVIDIA ConnectX-8 SuperNICs. The compute trays and NVLink switch trays are the building blocks of the GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution.

### Cooling Solutions

Water has 1000X more cooling capacity than air, is 25X better at transferring heat, and requires 10X less energy to move heat — making liquid cooling essential for modern AI infrastructure.

### Robotics

Humanoid robots, exoskeleton demonstrations, and autonomous robots were on display throughout the exhibit hall, showcasing the physical AI capabilities powered by NVIDIA's Isaac platform.

## Conclusion

Overall the conference was a lot of fun, with many interesting sessions and opportunities to meet experts and practitioners in the field. The sessions were well presented with energetic and clearly-expert presenters who were passionate about their topics.

Finally, doris.ai had a digital screen next to the conference store to help people digitally try clothes on, and I couldn't resist trying Jensen's signature black leather jacket:
